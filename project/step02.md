On this step #2 you'll create GitHub workflows to enable Continuous Integration on your TodoApp

## On this lab

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Goals](#goals)
- [Create GitHub Workflows](#create-github-workflows)

## Prerequisites

To complete this step you need to start with final version from [Step #1](step01.md) that have the needed Dockerfiles to create your images.

If you didn't finished [Step #1](step01.md), please download a version from [here](https://github.com/tasb/todo-app-dotnet-psql/archive/refs/tags/v2.zip).

## Goals

On this lab you'll have the following goals:

1. Create GitHub Workflows
2. Enable workflows to run automatically
3. Make your images to be created and push to Docker Hub only when changes happen on `main` branch.

## Create GitHub Workflows

Now it's time to create your GitHub workflows.

Recall what you have done on the lab of Module #7: [Enable CI on your codebase](../labs/lab06.md).
